# Hue-sensors-HASS
Component for Hue sensors in Home-assistant v0.62 and above.

**Note that a modified version of the hue hub component (components/hue.py) is used with the edits are listed at the bottom of this readme. The hub component has changed several times between 0.60 and 0.62 and hence there have been a few issues with this custom component. Hopefully the hub component is settled in 0.62.**

Place the custom_components folder in your configuration directory (or add its contents to an existing custom_components folder).

Hue dimmer remotes can be used for a click and long press (hold button for 2 sec and see LED blink twice).

Add to your config:

```
hue:
  bridges:
    - host: 192.168.0.100

sensor:
  - platform: hue
```

## Front end display

To add the following group to your HA frontend, add the following to groups.yaml (obviously editing to use your sensors):

```
default_view:
  view: yes
  entities:
    - group.Hue

Hue:
  entities:
    - sensor.bedroom_motion_sensor
    - sensor.hall_motion_sensor
    - sensor.living_room_motion_sensor
    - sensor.living_room_temperature
    - sensor.living_room_light_level
    - sensor.living_room_lux
    - sensor.living_room_remote
    - sensor.remote_bedroom
    - sensor.robins_iphone
```

Temperature, light level and other data in the sensor attributes can be broken out into their own sensor using a template sensor, for example:

```
- platform: template
  sensors:
    living_room_temperature:
      friendly_name: 'Living room temperature'
      value_template: '{{states.sensor.living_room_motion_sensor.attributes.temperature}}'
      unit_of_measurement: Â°C
```

## Changes to the official hue hub component

Changes to components/hue.py - adds sensors domain in setup() and adds get_sensor() method.

```
discovery.load_platform(
            self.hass, 'light', DOMAIN,
            {'bridge_id': self.bridge_id})
```

Becomes
```
PLATFORMS = ['light', 'sensor']

for platform in PLATFORMS:
     discovery.load_platform(
        self.hass, platform, DOMAIN,
        {'bridge_id': self.bridge_id})

# adds
def get_sensor(self):
    """Get sensor state."""
    return self.bridge.get_sensor()
```

## Debugging

If you get an error when using this component, the procedure for debugging is as follows.

1. Open an issue here on Github. Include the error message, release number of the custom component.
2. Download the Hue API response following the instructions [here](https://www.hackster.io/robin-cole/hijack-a-hue-remote-to-control-anything-with-home-assistant-5239a4#toc-hue-api-1). Save into a .json file.
3. Parse the json file using the [hue_sensors package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hue-sensors/1.2) and report the device ID (e.g. RWL_06-02) that is causing your issue.

There are a couple of examples of this process in the debugging_issues folder.
